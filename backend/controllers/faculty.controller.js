// Complaint Filing:
// The student files a complaint under a specific category.
// Each category has a faculty member assigned to handle complaints in that category. This faculty member is automatically linked to the complaint.
// 2. Faculty Resolving the Complaint:
// The assigned faculty member reviews the complaint, and when they resolve the issue, they provide details about the resolution in the resolutionDetails field.
// This can be a textual description that explains the action they took to address the issue, as we discussed earlier.
// 3. Updating Complaint Status:
// When the faculty member resolves the complaint, they also update the complaint status to "Resolved" (or any other appropriate status, such as "Closed", etc.).
// This status update reflects on the student's dashboard so they can see that their complaint has been handled.
// 4. Sending Notification to the Student:
// Once the complaint is resolved and the status is updated, a notification is sent to the student, informing them that their complaint has been resolved.
// The notification could include the resolutionDetails, giving the student the context on how their complaint was resolved.
// 5. Student's Dashboard Update:
// On the studentâ€™s dashboard, the complaint's status will be updated to reflect that it has been resolved (e.g., "Resolved" or "Closed").
// They can view the resolutionDetails provided by the faculty, which tells them what action was taken.
